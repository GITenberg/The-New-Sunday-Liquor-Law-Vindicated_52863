<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span><span

NEW SUNDAY LIQUOR LAW VINDICATED.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">An</span> Act came into operation in
August, denominated &ldquo;The New Beer Bill,&rdquo; requiring
public-houses to be closed on Sundays, with the exception of the
hours 1 to 3 p.m., and 6 to 10 p.m.&nbsp; No sooner was it passed
than it was found there was a great decrease in the number of
cases of persons charged with drunkenness at the various police
stations of the metropolis.&nbsp; Monday, instead of being a
heavy day, was the reverse&mdash;the magistrates had little or
nothing to do.&nbsp; But this great public good was not brought
about without inconveniencing some parties.&nbsp; The publicans
felt their craft was in danger,&mdash;that they were, as Benjamin
Disraeli informed them the other day at Plymouth, &ldquo;in a
critical situation;&rdquo; and that if they acquiesced in the
law, the result would be most unsatisfactory, pecuniarily, to
themselves.&nbsp; Accordingly, they have banded themselves into
one compact Defence Association&mdash;they have taken sweet
counsel together&mdash;they have organised an opposition all over
the land.&nbsp; Whether they have acted wisely is another matter:
with the evidence just published in two enormous Blue Books, I
think silence would become them better.&nbsp; And so thought the
knowing ones in the trade when they accepted the new Bill instead
of one that would have been harsher still.&nbsp; The opponents of
the Bill&mdash;publicans by-the-bye&mdash;thus speak of it: Mr.
Luce of Hampton Court, &ldquo;thinks it a despotic and tyrannical
Bill.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to a Mr. Symes, &ldquo;it is
directed against all recreation on Sundays&mdash;all relaxation
after the toils of the week.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Palmer said,
&ldquo;The Bill ought to be called the Liberty of the Subject and
Licensed Victuallers&rsquo; Liberty Curtailment
Bill.&rdquo;&nbsp; I take these extracts from the report of a
great meeting in Drury Lane in September.&nbsp; <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Mr. Lyne, also
a publican, writes in the <i>Daily News</i>, that &ldquo;since
the curfew bell there never was a measure which produced such
general discontent.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the genialness of the
weather the social gloom which has settled in the suburbs is
indescribable.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <i>Daily News</i>, in the poor
hope of saving itself from annihilation, by opposing the new
Bill, and thus becoming the organ of the pot-house
says:&mdash;&ldquo;The Pharisees of our drawing-rooms and saloons
ought, before they are allowed to hamper and annoy the honest
poor by their enactments, to be compelled to share for a season
in the labour of the poor, in order that they might have some
conception of the privations which they entail upon their
victims, and the possible consequences of such
privation.&rdquo;&nbsp; In another leader it draws the picture of
a working man returning from Brighton and starving in the streets
in consequence of the new Bill.&nbsp; Such is an outline of the
new Bill, as described by the publicans and their champion, the
<i>Daily News</i>.&nbsp; Never was there a greater outcry and so
little wool.&nbsp; One would fancy from the above remarks that an
injustice was being done&mdash;such as the world had never
witnessed before.&nbsp; You would have thought that at least we
had been robbed of <i>habeas corpus</i>, or that still more
valued right the Englishman&rsquo;s right to grumble.&nbsp; You
would have expected every print to be filled with tales of
terror&mdash;you would expect every man you met to have had a
face of woe, and especially that the working classes, who have
been robbed of their rights in so atrocious a manner, would have
talked of armed resistance, or at least have provided themselves
with pikes.&nbsp; The working men have not held a single meeting
on the matter&mdash;not one single groan has been wrung from them
by the unheard of oppression under which they now labour.&nbsp;
So callous and indifferent are they&mdash;so utterly callous and
indifferent are all other classes of society&mdash;that the
publicans have been compelled to come forward and so do battle
for the working man.&nbsp; What disinterested public
spirit!&nbsp; English liberty, torn, bruised, bleeding, shunned
by all who once worshipped her and whom she once blessed, finds
refuge in a public-house!&nbsp; If you want her you must go to
the King&rsquo;s Arms, or the Red Lion, and call for a pint of
beer.</p>
<p>But I have over-stated my case: there have been some
complaints from parties not publicans after all.&nbsp; On looking
through a file of the <i>Daily News</i> for the last three months
I find three such.&nbsp; No. 1, is there placed in the largest
type, and headed, &ldquo;Starvation by Act of
Parliament!&rdquo;&nbsp; You are <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>alarmed.&nbsp; Read on, your fears
will soon cease.&nbsp; The writer says:&mdash;&ldquo;Sir, I am a
bachelor living in chambers, the resources of my
<i>m&eacute;nage</i> do not extend to cooking a dinner, and, like
most persons in my situation, I generally dine at a tavern in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; On Sunday, I attended the afternoon service
at Saint Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, and upon my return at five
o&rsquo;clock (what a circumstantial dog he is!) I repaired with
my appetite in excellent condition to my usual dining-place in
Fleet-street.&nbsp; I was rather taken aback at finding a closed
door frowning upon me; but I rang the bell, and, after a brief
delay, a small part of the door was cautiously opened, and there
appeared in the apeture the head of a disconsolate looking
waiter, who told me that the establishment was closed in
compliance with the provision of the New Beer Bill, and that
consequently I could not have any dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; The next
deep pang of anguish bursts from the bleeding bosom of a Templar,
who says:&mdash;&ldquo;I am a victim of this Act, being scarcely
able to get any dinner before the Sunday evening
service.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another, a father of a family, says he
dines at five, and he finds the beer flat.&nbsp; That I imagine
is his own fault.&nbsp; Surely it was not the Act of Parliament
did that.&nbsp; We shall next be told when the beer turns sour
that was also the Act of Parliament.&nbsp; But perhaps I am
wrong.&nbsp; A well-known judge declared Parliament could do
every thing but make a woman a man or a man a woman.&nbsp; So,
after all, the father of a family may be right, and the New Beer
Bill may be the reason why his &ldquo;arf-and-arf&rdquo; is
flat.</p>
<p>Now, I ask, is it not ridiculous, on the face of it, that an
Act of Parliament should be set aside, because a bachelor finds,
once upon a time, the door of his favourite hotel shut in his
face; or because a Templar says he can&rsquo;t dine till near the
time for evening service,&mdash;though, for the life of me, I
can&rsquo;t see why he cannot; or because the father of a family
finds his beer is flat: yet this is all the complaint I find,
even in the <i>Daily News</i>.&nbsp; We are told the working men
are robbed of their rights.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t find the working
men complain,&mdash;why should they?&nbsp; They know better than
that.&nbsp; The law, as it stands, allows the working man to get
all the beer he wants; and if you turn to the evidence lately
given before a Committee of the House of Commons, you will find
that the working classes are in favour of the change, and that
many of them, even the most drunken and dissipated, feel that it
would be a good thing if the <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>public-houses could be closed
altogether on Sundays.&nbsp; Many of the most respectable
publicans in the metropolis gave similar evidence before the same
Committee.&nbsp; All the moral and decent people in the country
are of a similar opinion.&nbsp; The Provost of Edinburgh shows
that when Forbes Mackenzie&rsquo;s Act came into operation in
Edinburgh drunkenness and crime decreased; that when the
magistrates allowed it to fall into abeyance, drunkenness and
crime increased.&nbsp; Evidence was read before the Committee, by
the Rev. Mr. Baylee, to show that some years since a great
reformation had been effected by the partial closing of
public-houses, and Mr. Balfour showed how the metropolis had
improved in this respect within the last few years.&nbsp; The
question is, Is this improvement to be continued?&nbsp; No one
expects to make men moral by Act of Parliament; no one expects
the policeman to take the parson&rsquo;s place; but when we see a
great good done,&mdash;when we see a fruitful source of crime and
poverty and disease arrested, are we to pause because a Templar
cannot dine till evening service, or because the father of a
family complains that his beer is flat?&nbsp; I forgot the
publicans: are they to stop the way?&nbsp; I trust not.&nbsp; It
is nonsense to say the working-man is deprived of his beer; he is
not.&nbsp; All the beer a man needs he can buy now.&nbsp; The
public-houses are allowed to be open sufficiently for that
purpose.&nbsp; It is clear what the publicans are fighting for;
the welfare of the working-man is a mere pretence,&mdash;the
rights of Englishmen is a mere pretence,&mdash;they want to sell
more beer,&mdash;to sell the beer that shall intoxicate; all that
the new Bill seeks to do is to prevent a man sitting all Sunday
night in a public-house, spending his last shilling there, and
thus robbing his wife and family of that which should feed and
clothe and maintain them during the week.&nbsp; The publicans
themselves confess the Sunday trade is an abominable one.&nbsp;
More than one publican, examined before the Committee, confessed
this to be the case.&nbsp; The evidence of Mr. Wayland, the
Marylebone City missionary, and others, all went to show that it
is the Sunday drinking that does so much harm, and that was the
effect of the late hours at which public-houses were allowed to
be kept open.</p>
<p>I have just seen forty-eight circulars returned from various
employers of labour in different parts of the metropolis,
addressed to them by the Committee of the London Temperance
League.&nbsp; The questions proposed were as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Have <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>you perceived any change with respect
to the hour at which your workpeople commence their labours on
Monday morning?&nbsp; Have you noticed any improvement, or
otherwise, with respect to the aggregate amount of time your
workpeople are at their employment during the entire week?&nbsp;
What is your opinion as to the general effects of the recent Act
or Parliament in relation to the management of public-houses, or
upon the happiness and well-being of your workpeople?&nbsp; Is it
your opinion that the hours during which spirituous and fermented
drinks may be obtained on Sundays should be subject to further
restrictions?&rdquo;&nbsp; Of these replies thirty-two were
favourable,&mdash;twelve decidedly the reverse, and four
neutral.&nbsp; Thus we have employers in favour of the new
Bill,&mdash;the poor in its favour,&mdash;many of the publicans,
who feel the Sunday trade not to be respectable,&mdash;in short
all classes in its favour except one, and that a section of the
publicans who want to sell more beer, and, to do so, cant about
the interests of the working classes and the liberty of
Englishmen.&nbsp; Cant at all times is loathsome; the cant of the
hypocrite is bad enough, but this is infinitely worse.&nbsp; I
know nothing more nauseating, nothing more false.&nbsp; Men talk
about the cant of the religious&mdash;and we have too much of
that; but that does no harm: but this cant is intolerable,
one&rsquo;s stomach turns at it; this raising the fair banner of
freedom to pander to the demoralization of the public,&mdash;this
talk by the publican of the rights of the working-man, in order
that he may be decoyed into the public-house and made drunk, and
robbed of all he has, is cant as fearful and sickening as any
ever uttered.</p>
<p>There may be defects in the Bill; I do not say there are
not.&nbsp; Like most pieces of parliamentary legislation it is
bungling enough, and the convenient latitude attached to the
definition of the word &ldquo;traveller&rdquo; may rob it of
almost all its beneficial effects.&nbsp; That it may also create
occasional inconvenience I freely admit, but the case at present
is all in its favour; the protest raised against it is the
same.&nbsp; But the publicans oppose it.&nbsp; I could understand
if the public-houses were altogether closed on Sundays they might
say it robbed the public of reasonable refreshment; but they have
no pretext of the kind, and their opposition is now, I take it,
the strongest argument in favour of the Bill.&nbsp; It is clear,
now, why they oppose it; it is not the benefit of the public they
seek so much as their own.&nbsp; It is the drinking beyond what
is reasonable,&mdash;the intoxication <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>of the working classes on the Sunday
night,&mdash;the repetition of the scenes which have already
brought such disgrace on the land, and such misery on our homes,
for which they fight.&nbsp; For these reasons they denounce the
Bill.&nbsp; For these reasons every well-wisher to his country,
every sober man and woman, should give the Bill their hearty
support, taking it for good as far as it goes, and seeking, if
any change be made, that the change be one which the publicans
shall like even less.&nbsp; We are told there is to be a contest;
we are told the publicans will not let well alone; we are told
next session they will agitate for the removal of this
&ldquo;unjust and iniquitous law.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let them do so; it
will be the worst day&rsquo;s work for them they ever did.&nbsp;
Let them do so, and an agitation will be begun, and a public
sentiment will be created, and an array of facts shall be turned
against them, as shall shake their trade to its very base.&nbsp;
Wisdom would counsel them silence.&nbsp; Wisdom would recommend
them not to call public attention to their craft&mdash;as they
will not follow her guidance,&mdash;as they find fault with the
Committee and the <i>Advertiser</i>, which accepted the Bill
rather than see one more stringent passed, the masses can await
with confidence the result.&nbsp; The middle classes of this
country know the horror of Sabbath drinking too well, the poor of
this country know it too well; neither are to be cajoled by a
pretence, on the part of the publicans, to advocate their
interests or uphold their rights.&nbsp; It is a question of the
public on one side and the publicans on the other.&nbsp; The
agitation against the Bill is the most shameless, selfish,
dishonest agitation ever begun in this country.&nbsp; I know not
if it will be continued much longer; I know that if it is, it
will have most disastrous results, so far as the publicans are
concerned.&nbsp; If even Disraeli will refuse to make political
capital out of them, notwithstanding their urgent request to the
contrary, they must be in a doleful plight.&nbsp; Their cause
must be bad indeed.&nbsp; Their battle must be lost almost before
it be begun.</p>

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
